    > "On February 28, 1956, the first two buses arrived in Oviedo to begin replacing
    the tram. These were two Pegasos that operated on the Colloto - Cruce de las Caldas
    line, and the local humor dubbed them **sidrobuses** due to their popular use for
    going to drink sidra (cider) in Colloto." - [Transportes Unidos de Asturias,
