> "On February 28, 1956, the first two buses arrived in Oviedo to begin replacing the tram. These were two Pegasos that operated on the Colloto - Cruce de las Caldas line, and the local humor dubbed them **sidrobuses** due to their popular use for going to drink sidra (cider) in Colloto." - [Transportes Unidos de Asturias, Historia](https://www.tua.es/es/tua/historia/)
